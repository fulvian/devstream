## 🔧 Issues Identified and Resolved

During the validation process, we identified and systematically resolved several critical issues:

### 1. **TaskType Enum Alignment** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Database constraint expected `'analysis', 'coding', 'documentation', 'testing', 'review', 'research'` but TaskType enum used different values
- **Resolution**: Updated TaskType enum to match database constraints
- **Impact**: Eliminated all task creation failures

### 2. **Missing PhaseQueries Implementation** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: QueryManager lacked `phases` attribute, preventing phase management
- **Resolution**: Created comprehensive PhaseQueries class with CRUD operations
- **Impact**: Enabled proper phase lifecycle management

### 3. **SemanticMemoryQueries Missing Method** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: `get_by_id` method was missing from SemanticMemoryQueries
- **Resolution**: Added proper `get_by_id` method with JSON field parsing
- **Impact**: Enabled memory retrieval validation in tests

### 4. **MicroTaskQueries Status Management** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Missing `update_status` method preventing task status updates
- **Resolution**: Added `update_status` and `get_active_tasks` methods
- **Impact**: Complete task lifecycle management functionality

### 5. **Task Status Constraint Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Database expected `'active'` but code used `'in_progress'`
- **Resolution**: Added status mapping in `update_status` method
- **Impact**: Proper status transitions working correctly
