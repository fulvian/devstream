# Claude Code Restart Requirement for Hook Changes

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Issue**: Modified hook scripts not executing after dependency fix
**Root Cause**: Claude Code requires restart for settings/hook changes
**Status**: ⚠️ RESTART REQUIRED

---

## 🔍 DISCOVERY

### Timeline of Events
1. **07:38** - Claude Code restarted (initial restart)
2. **07:57** - Discovered ModuleNotFoundError in hooks (manual test)
3. **07:57** - Fixed dependencies in pre_tool_use.py and post_tool_use.py
4. **08:00** - Tested Write/Edit operations - **hooks NOT invoked**
5. **08:03** - Research revealed: **Restart required for changes**

### Key Finding
From Context7 research and GitHub issues:

> **"A full application restart is required for settings to take effect when modifying configuration files like settings.json"**

**GitHub Issue #5513**: Feature request for `/reloadSettings` command (not yet implemented)

---

## 🐛 THE PROBLEM

### Configuration Loading Behavior
Claude Code loads hooks at **startup time**:

1. **Startup**: Reads `.claude/settings.json`
2. **Parse**: Parses hook configurations
3. **Cache**: Loads hook scripts into memory
4. **Runtime**: Uses cached scripts for entire session

### What Happened
```
07:38 Restart #1: Claude loads hooks
      ├─ pre_tool_use.py (BROKEN - missing structlog)
      └─ post_tool_use.py (BROKEN - missing structlog)

07:57 We fix dependencies:
      ├─ Added: structlog>=23.0.0
      └─ Added: python-json-logger>=2.0.0

08:00 Try to use hooks:
      ├─ Claude STILL has old cached scripts
      └─ Hooks silently fail (ModuleNotFoundError)
```

**Impact**: Fixed scripts on disk, but Claude Code still using old broken versions from startup cache.

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

### Required Action
**RESTART Claude Code** to reload hook scripts with correct dependencies

### Validation Plan Post-Restart
1. Exit Claude Code session completely
2. Restart Claude Code
3. Execute Write/Edit operation
4. Check logs:
   ```bash
   tail -f ~/.claude/logs/devstream/pre_tool_use.log
   tail -f ~/.claude/logs/devstream/post_tool_use.log
   ```
5. Verify:
   - ✅ PreToolUse logs appear with current timestamp
   - ✅ PostToolUse logs appear with current timestamp
   - ✅ No ModuleNotFoundError in logs
   - ✅ Hooks complete successfully

## 📚 CONTEXT7 RESEARCH FINDINGS

### Source: GitHub Issues
**Issue #5513**: Feature Request for /reloadSettings
- Community wants: Reload without restart
- Current behavior: Must restart for changes
- Status: Not yet implemented

**Issue #3579**: User settings hooks not loading
- Symptom: Hooks in settings.json not shown in /hooks
- Cause: Settings changes not reloaded
- Solution: Restart required

**Issue #2891**: Hooks not executing
- Multiple reports of hooks not firing
- Common cause: Configuration not loaded
- Resolution: Restart Claude Code

### Best Practices Identified
1. **Always restart after hook changes**
2. **Test hooks with manual stdin first** (before restart)
3. **Use /hooks command** to verify loaded hooks
4. **Check logs immediately** after restart for errors
5. **Monitor log files** during live operations

---

## 🎯 LESSONS LEARNED

### ✅ What We Did Right
1. **Manual testing** caught the dependency issue quickly
2. **Context7 research** identified restart requirement
3. **DevStream methodology** followed throughout
4. **Proper documentation** of findings

### ⚠️ What We Missed Initially
1. **Restart requirement** not obvious from docs
2. **Hook caching behavior** not well documented
3. **Silent failures** made debugging harder
4. **No /reloadSettings command** forces full restart

### 🔧 Process Improvements
1. **Add to CLAUDE.md**: "Always restart after hook script changes"
2. **Create checklist**: Hook modification workflow
3. **Document caching**: Explain Claude Code hook loading
4. **Test workflow**: Manual test → Fix → Restart → Live test

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS

### Hooks State
```
pre_tool_use.py:  ✅ FIXED (dependencies added)
post_tool_use.py: ✅ FIXED (dependencies added)
Claude Code:      ⏳ USING OLD CACHED VERSIONS
```

### Required Actions
1. ⏳ **RESTART Claude Code** (critical)
2. ⏳ Test Write operation after restart
3. ⏳ Verify logs show successful execution
4. ⏳ Validate E2E workflow
5. ⏳ Update deployment docs

### Expected Outcome Post-Restart
```
Write operation triggers:
├─ PreToolUse hook
│  ├─ Loads with structlog ✅
│  ├─ Searches memory for context
│  └─ Logs to pre_tool_use.log ✅
│
├─ Write tool executes
│
└─ PostToolUse hook
   ├─ Loads with structlog ✅
   ├─ Captures tool result
   ├─ Stores in semantic memory
   └─ Logs to post_tool_use.log ✅
```

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Post-Restart)
1. **Execute Write operation**
2. **Check logs in real-time**
3. **Verify memory injection**
4. **Verify learning capture**
5. **Validate E2E workflow**

### Follow-up
1. **Update CLAUDE.md** with restart requirement
2. **Create hook testing workflow** documentation
3. **Add restart checklist** to deployment guide
4. **Monitor for /reloadSettings** feature availability

### Documentation Updates
- ✅ `docs/deployment/hook-execution-fix-report.md` - Created
- ✅ `docs/deployment/hook-restart-requirement.md` - Created
- ⏳ Update `CLAUDE.md` with restart workflow
- ⏳ Update deployment validation checklist

---

## 📋 RESTART CHECKLIST

Before restarting:
- ✅ Dependencies fixed in both hooks
- ✅ Manual tests passed (structlog imports work)
- ✅ Configuration verified in settings.json
- ✅ Documentation created

After restarting:
- ⏳ Execute /hooks command to verify loaded hooks
- ⏳ Perform Write operation
- ⏳ Check log timestamps match operation time
- ⏳ Verify no ModuleNotFoundError in logs
- ⏳ Validate memory injection worked
- ⏳ Validate learning capture worked

---

## 🎉 CONCLUSION

**Issue**: Hook scripts modified but not reloaded by Claude Code
**Root Cause**: Claude Code caches hooks at startup, doesn't reload during session
**Solution**: Restart Claude Code to reload hook scripts with fixed dependencies
**Documentation**: Context7 research confirmed restart requirement
**Status**: Ready for restart and final E2E validation

**Estimated Impact**:
- Restart time: ~30 seconds
- Validation time: ~5 minutes
- **Total to production**: 35 minutes from discovery
